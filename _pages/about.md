Iâ€™m a research intern in NLP Research lab at Nanyang Technological University <a href="https://www.vinai.io/"></a> under supervision of Dr. <a href="https://tuanluu.github.io/">Tuan Luu</a>. In August 2022, I will become first-year PhD student at National University of Singapore, advised by Professor See-Kiong Ng. Currently, my research interests are Natural Language Processing, particularly Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization, and Machine Learning, specifically Representation Learning and Optimization.
