I’m a resident at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/">VinAI Research</a> under supervision of Dr. <a href="https://tuanluu.github.io/">Tuan Luu</a>. Currently, I’m also a fourth-year undergraduate student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, advised by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Tho Quan. Moreover, I also had a wonderful time working with Dr. <a href="https://tuanluu.github.io/">Tuan Luu</a> as a Research Assistant at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

Currently, my research interests are Natural Language Processing, particularly Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Summarization, and Machine Learning, specifically Representation Learning and Optimization.
