I am a PhD student advised by Professor <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ngsk/">See-Kiong Ng</a> and Professor <a href="https://tuanluu.github.io/">Anh-Tuan Luu</a> at National University of Singapore, where I was fortunate enough to be funded by a <a href="https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/recipients/">Google PhD Fellowship</a> and AI Singapore PhD Fellowship. Currently, my research interests are in Multimodal Learning, particularly Video-Language Modeling (VidLM) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
